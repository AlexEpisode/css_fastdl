Map by: Dr.Boo
Name: de_xmas_hotel
Type: Bomb/Diffuse

Description: The terrorists want to bomb the Hotel De La Merde in the French alps. They want to blow up the storage room on the first floor, and the meeting room on the second. Don't ask my why they'd want to blow up an empty meeting room and a fucking storage room tho. I have no idea. Why are you even reading this shit?
